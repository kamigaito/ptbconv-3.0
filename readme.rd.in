== ((<ptbconv-@VERSION@|URL:http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~h-yamada/software/ptbconv-@VERSION@.tar.gz>))

Converter for Penn treebank corpus. This script requires
((<Ruby|URL:http://www.ruby-lang.org>)) 1.8.2 or later.

=== How to install

   % cd ptbconv-@VERSION@/ ; 
   % ./configure
   % ./make

=== How to use
Run this script with -h option and see them.

   % ./ptbconv -h

=== Output Formats
=== Phrase Structure Trees
((* ASCII Tree From *))

If you run this script with -V option, you can see syntactic trees on
your terminal in ASCII forms.  None-terminal nodes are described as
"Label<head child>" . Terminal nodes are described as
"word/part-of-speech".

      (Example)

            Such/JJ-+            
                    |               
               a/DT-+NP<3>-+    
                    |       
        proposal/NN-+       
  
where the number "3" in "NP<3>" denotes the head child index in its
children. In above example, "proposal/NN" is the head of
"NP<3>". About rules of head identification, see ((<Head Rules>)).  In
the original Penn treebank the tag "-NONE-" is annotated for gaps. If
you want to see trees with -NONE- tags, run this script with -g
option. (In our current implementation, if the size of the input tree
is too large, it can not display correctly.  Please enlarge your
terminal screen or use the higher resolution display.)

((* CFG rules *))

Run this script with -C option, it extracts CFG rules of the input trees. 
For example, 

     S<2> -> NP VP

<n> shows the index of head constituent, i.e., the head constituent of "S" is 2nd. constituent "VP". 

=== Dependency Structure Trees
((* ASCII Tree Form *))

Each node is expressed as "word/part-of-speech" forms. 

    (Example)
    
                I/PRP-+            
                      |               
                      +read/VBD-+
                      |       
      the/DT-+        |
             +book/NN-+       

The root node of this sentence is "read/VBD". 

((* List Form *))

The list output form of our converter consists of three columns: word,
POS and ((*num*)).

    (Example)

        I     PRP   2
        read  VBD   -1
        the   DT    4
        book  NN    2
        .     .     2

where ((*num*)) denotes that the word modifies num-th word.  For example,
in above sentence the first word "I" modifies 2nd. word "read".
The root nodes of dependency trees are expressed as negative number
"-1". 

=== Head Rules

This script converts phrase structure forms of Penn treebank into
dependency forms using simple head rules.  These rules are almost
similar to Collins' one (see page 238 on his ((<PhD
dissertation|URL:http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/mcollins/publications.html>))). But
we haven't implemented some special rules about NP and CONJP yet.  All
our rules are expressed priority lists for each none terminal node.
If you want to see our head rules, please run this script with -H
option.
 
The current best statistical parser, A Maximum-Entropy-Inspired Parser
(meip) proposed by ((<Charniak|URL:http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/ec/>)), deals with some
extended part-of-speech tags, AUX and AUXG.  If you want to convert
the outputs of charniak's parser into our dependency forms, please use
"-R meip" option.
